In the ever-shifting ledger of near-Earth object (NEO) risks, **asteroid 2024 YR4** remains a headline maker. Discovered in late 2024, the rock’s shifting orbital solutions carried it from a brief—but arresting—Earth-impact scare to today’s far subtler possibility: a **4.3 % chance of grazing the Moon** on **22 December 2032**.

That latest figure arrives courtesy of the **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)**. In May 2025, Webb’s **Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam)** captured one last image set of 2024 YR4 before the asteroid slipped too far from the inner Solar System for any instrument—ground or space—to catch. Those data, fed to NASA’s **Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS)** in Pasadena and folded into JPL’s Sentry impact-monitoring system, **tightened the uncertainty ellipse around YR4’s 2032 coordinates by almost 20 %**. Earth’s danger remains effectively zero, but the Moon’s odds ticked up from 3.8 % to 4.3 %.

Below, we unpack how a single Webb snapshot can shift celestial probabilities; why a Moon impact, though scientifically tantalising, poses no threat to Earth; and what 2024 YR4’s journey tells us about the broader business of planetary defence.

#### From Earth Threat to Lunar Possibility

##### The Early Alarm

In February 2025—barely six weeks after discovery—preliminary fits placed a **3.1 % Earth-impact chance** on 2024 YR4. That number briefly crowned the asteroid “the most hazardous object of modern times” in many media reports. Veterans at CNEOS and ESA’s NEO Coordination Centre urged patience, predicting the risk would plummet as follow-up arcs rolled in. They were right: by early March the impact probability sank below one-ten-thousandth of a percent, effectively clearing Earth.

##### A New Target Emerges

Yet orbital mechanics is a three-body ballet. The refined path threaded YR4 squarely through the Earth–Moon system. Gravitational tugs, projection uncertainties, and chaotic perturbations kept a **few-percent chance** that the rock might clip the lunar farside in late 2032. A Moon strike would create a fresh scar—of interest to selenologists—but **would not alter the Moon’s orbit**, tidal forces, or Earth’s night sky in any meaningful way.

#### Webb’s One-Shot Opportunity

##### Catching a Fading Target

By April 2025, 2024 YR4 had receded beyond 1.5 AU, its apparent magnitude dimmer than 25—well past most ground telescopes’ reach. Webb, orbiting at L2 with a 6.5-metre mirror and cryo-cooled instruments, held one last trump card. An **international team** led by Dr Andy Rivkin (Johns Hopkins APL) petitioned for Director’s Discretionary Time and won **a single 30-minute NIRCam session** in early May. The window closed days later as YR4 drifted sunward.

##### Why Infrared Matters

At such distances the asteroid appears as a faint point source, yet NIRCam’s wavelength range (0.6–5 µm) captures reflected sunlight and a hint of thermal glow. By **measuring its position against a lattice of background stars** with sub-arcsecond precision, astronomers trimmed the orbital error bars—especially along the line of sight, historically the weakest dimension for fast-moving NEOs.

##### A 20 % Precision Boost

Back at JPL, orbitalists ingested the Webb astrometry into their least-squares model. **The predicted 2032 flyby corridor shrank by one-fifth**, enough to shift some Monte-Carlo clones from safe lunar flybys into low-velocity impact solutions. Hence the **4.3 % lunar probability** now quoted on NASA’s Sentry Risk Table.

#### What a Moon Impact Would Look Like

##### Energy Budget

YR4’s estimated diameter sits between **50 m and 65 m**; mass, assuming an S-type density near 3 g/cm³, hovers around 6–10 million tonnes. At 11 km/s—the typical geocentric speed for a rock arriving from the inner asteroid belt—it would release **roughly 8 × 10¹⁴ joules** on impact. That’s comparable to **200 kilotons of TNT**, several times the Chelyabinsk airburst but orders of magnitude below global-threat thresholds.

##### Crater Size

Simple scaling laws predict a fresh **crater 300–450 m wide**, shallow compared to lunar giants like Tycho (85 km) but **large enough** for orbiters such as NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) or the upcoming Artemis infrastructure to image crisp rim structures, ejecta rays, and melt ponds.

##### Scientific Goldmine

A confirmed impact date would trigger a multi-agency campaign:

- **Optical flashes** captured by Earth-based telescopes on the nightside.
- **Seismic waves** sensed by future lunar seismometers, renewing Apollo-era experiments.
- **Ejecta plume spectroscopy**, revealing subsurface mineralogy otherwise hidden from remote sensing.

#### Why Earth Remains Safe

##### Orbital Divergence

YR4’s Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) with Earth now bottoms out above 0.004 AU (~600,000 km) in 2032—**beyond the average lunar orbit**. Even with gravitational keyholes, further long-period resonances push subsequent close approaches into the late 22nd century, by which time YR4 will likely have been perturbed into a benign heliocentric path or catalogued to millimetre precision.

##### Planetary Defence Philosophy

Planetary defenders track thousands of NEOs. Most initial scares dissipate quickly; the key is **early detection** and **rapid refinement**. Webb’s cameo shows how a single high-precision data point—even late in the tracking arc—can sharpen long-term forecasts and shift priorities away from Earth-centric mitigation to pure science planning.

#### Waiting for 2028

##### The Next Observation Window

YR4’s 4.1-year heliocentric period delivers an **Earth-adjacent pass in mid-2028**. Then, the asteroid will brighten to magnitude ~21—ripe for a global observing campaign spanning radar (Goldstone, Green Bank), optical surveys (LSST at Vera Rubin Observatory), and perhaps another Webb look if schedule allows.

##### What 2028 Can Settle

- **Bulk Shape**: Lightcurve inversion with multi-facility photometry could confirm the disk-like silhouette hinted at by Gemini South.
- **Precise Size**: Radar echoes will nail down diameter to ±5 m, ending the 50–65 m debate.
- **Rotation State**: Minute-scale photometry can reveal non-principal-axis spin or YORP-induced acceleration.
- **Thermal Inertia & Composition**: Webb’s MIRI, if allocated time, could constrain surface roughness and silicate vs. metal fractions.

With those metrics, 2032 lunar-impact odds will be pinned down to fractions of a percent—either confirming a likely miss or scheduling the Solar System’s most anticipated cosmic fireworks show.

#### Broader Implications for NEO Science

##### Cross-Agency Synergy

The YR4 saga exemplifies seamless cooperation: discovery surveys trigger alerts; follow-up telescopes refine trajectories; flagship observatories like Webb provide high-precision data; planetary scientists fold those results back into risk models; and agencies communicate updates transparently to the public.

##### Public Communication Challenges

Headlines toggling from “city-killer” to “zero risk” to “Moon impact” can confuse non-experts. Robust outreach—explainers on MOIDs, probability evolution, and why 4.3 % is still tiny—remains essential. As Dr Kelly Fast (NASA’s NEO Observations Program) notes, “Probabilities breathe; what counts is the trend.” In YR4’s case, the trend for Earth is reassuringly downward.

##### The Value of High-Precision Astrometry

Webb is not designed as a survey telescope, yet its occasional NEO snapshots wield outsized influence. Sub-arcsecond positions, especially along the radial component, carve whole swaths off uncertainty ellipses. Future missions—Roman Space Telescope, NEO Surveyor—will wield similar, dedicated power on a grander scale.

**Asteroid 2024 YR4** has navigated an arc of public perception: from Earth-impact scare to lunar-target curiosity. Webb’s May 2025 observation nudged its **Moon-strike odds to 4.3 %**, tightened orbital knowledge by 20 %, and underscored the synergy of global planetary-defence assets.

Earth remains safe. The Moon, while facing a remote bullet, would endure the hit unscarred from a dynamical standpoint—though selenologists would cheer the science bonanza. For now, YR4 slips beyond instrument reach until 2028, when a fresh data cascade should resolve its fate once and for all.

Whether it carves a modest crater on lunar regolith or simply sails onward into the black, 2024 YR4 already serves its greatest purpose: reminding humanity that vigilance, precision, and international cooperation keep our planetary backyard secure—and occasionally gift us front-row seats to celestial spectacles.
