## Introduction

In the ever-shifting ledger of near-Earth object (NEO) risks, **asteroid 2024 YR4** remains a headline maker. Discovered in late 2024, the rock’s shifting orbital solutions carried it from a brief—but arresting—Earth-impact scare to today’s far subtler possibility: a **4.3 % chance of grazing the Moon** on **22 December 2032**.

That latest figure arrives courtesy of the **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)**. In May 2025, Webb’s **Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam)** captured one last image set of 2024 YR4 before the asteroid slipped too far from the inner Solar System for any instrument—ground or space—to catch. Those data, fed to NASA’s **Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS)** in Pasadena and folded into JPL’s Sentry impact-monitoring system, **tightened the uncertainty ellipse around YR4’s 2032 coordinates by almost 20 %**. Earth’s danger remains effectively zero, but the Moon’s odds ticked up from 3.8 % to 4.3 %.

Below, we unpack how a single Webb snapshot can shift celestial probabilities; why a Moon impact, though scientifically tantalising, poses no threat to Earth; and what 2024 YR4’s journey tells us about the broader business of planetary defence.

## 1. From Earth Threat to Lunar Possibility

### 1.1 The Early Alarm

In February 2025—barely six weeks after discovery—preliminary fits placed a **3.1 % Earth-impact chance** on 2024 YR4. That number briefly crowned the asteroid “the most hazardous object of modern times” in many media reports. Veterans at CNEOS and ESA’s NEO Coordination Centre urged patience, predicting the risk would plummet as follow-up arcs rolled in. They were right: by early March the impact probability sank below one-ten-thousandth of a percent, effectively clearing Earth.

### 1.2 A New Target Emerges

Yet orbital mechanics is a three-body ballet. The refined path threaded YR4 squarely through the Earth–Moon system. Gravitational tugs, projection uncertainties, and chaotic perturbations kept a **few-percent chance** that the rock might clip the lunar farside in late 2032. A Moon strike would create a fresh scar—of interest to selenologists—but **would not alter the Moon’s orbit**, tidal forces, or Earth’s night sky in any meaningful way.

## 2. Webb’s One-Shot Opportunity

### 2.1 Catching a Fading Target

By April 2025, 2024 YR4 had receded beyond 1.5 AU, its apparent magnitude dimmer than 25—well past most ground telescopes’ reach. Webb, orbiting at L2 with a 6.5-metre mirror and cryo-cooled instruments, held one last trump card. An **international team** led by Dr Andy Rivkin (Johns Hopkins APL) petitioned for Director’s Discretionary Time and won **a single 30-minute NIRCam session** in early May. The window closed days later as YR4 drifted sunward.

### 2.2 Why Infrared Matters

At such distances the asteroid appears as a faint point source, yet NIRCam’s wavelength range (0.6–5 µm) captures reflected sunlight and a hint of thermal glow. By **measuring its position against a lattice of background stars** with sub-arcsecond precision, astronomers trimmed the orbital error bars—especially along the line of sight, historically the weakest dimension for fast-moving NEOs.

### 2.3 A 20 % Precision Boost

Back at JPL, orbitalists ingested the Webb astrometry into their least-squares model. **The predicted 2032 flyby corridor shrank by one-fifth**, enough to shift some Monte-Carlo clones from safe lunar flybys into low-velocity impact solutions. Hence the **4.3 % lunar probability** now quoted on NASA’s Sentry Risk Table.

## 3. What a Moon Impact Would Look Like

### 3.1 Energy Budget

YR4’s estimated diameter sits between **50 m and 65 m**; mass, assuming an S-type density near 3 g/cm³, hovers around 6–10 million tonnes. At 11 km/s—the typical geocentric speed for a rock arriving from the inner asteroid belt—it would release **roughly 8 × 10¹⁴ joules** on impact. That’s comparable to **200 kilotons of TNT**, several times the Chelyabinsk airburst but orders of magnitude below global-threat thresholds.

### 3.2 Crater Size
