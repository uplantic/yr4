#### Introduction

When **asteroid 2024 YR4** first appeared in late 2024, its brief stint on NASA’s hazard list made global headlines. Subsequent tracking ruled out an Earth impact, but scientists never lost interest. A new **three-dimensional model** from Chile’s **Gemini South telescope** now reveals that YR4 is shaped less like a potato and more like a **hockey puck** — a flat, disk-like body spinning once every **20 minutes**. Researchers also traced its origins to the **inner asteroid belt**, likely nudged sunward by Jupiter’s gravity.

The findings, announced by the **National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab)**, deepen our understanding of YR4’s physical properties, refine its size to **30–65 meters** (with Webb data favoring ≈ 60 m), and keep alive a tantalizing **few-percent chance** of a **lunar impact on 22 December 2032**. Such an event would pose no danger to Earth yet offer a unique test of how crater size scales with projectile mass.

#### Discovery and Early Hazard Phase

**27 December 2024:** The ATLAS survey in Chile spots a faint object cruising away from Earth barely two days after a flyby twice the Moon’s distance. Provisional designations give way to **2024 YR4**.

_February 2025:_ Orbital uncertainties produce a worrisome **3.1 % Earth-impact probability** for 22 December 2032, briefly crowning YR4 the “most dangerous asteroid” of the modern tracking era. For several weeks it tops NASA’s Sentry Risk Table and ESA’s Impact Risk List — unusually long for a fresh discovery this size.

_Late February 2025:_ Additional astrometry drops Earth risk to nearly zero but leaves a **Moon-strike window** open at ~ 4 %. The Torino Scale rating falls from **Level 3** (requiring public attention) to **Level 1** (normal).

#### Why the Gemini Campaign?

Even after Earth was cleared, researchers wanted better constraints on:

- **Shape** — key for thermal modeling and YORP torque studies.
- **Rotation period** — informs structural integrity (rubble pile vs. monolith).
- **Size** — directly influences crater energy if it ever does collide with the Moon.

Gemini South’s **8.1-m mirror** and fast-readout detectors were ideal for capturing high signal-to-noise lightcurves before YR4 faded beyond ground-based reach.

#### Constructing a 3D Model

Lightcurve inversion techniques translate brightness variations into a three-dimensional shape:

1. **Multi-filter imaging** (visible to near-IR) every few minutes as YR4 rotates.
2. **Phase-angle diversity**: Observations from different Sun–target–observer angles.
3. **Fourier analysis** to extract periodicities and amplitude.
4. **Convex-hull algorithms** to rebuild the silhouette that best matches the data.

The result: a flattened ellipsoid just **⅓ as tall as it is wide**, resembling a spinning hockey puck more than a typical lumpy asteroid.

#### A Hockey-Puck in Space: Shape and Spin

Most sub-100-m asteroids fall into three categories:

- **Potato-like rubble piles** (randomly shaped, slow rotators).
- **Top-shaped fast rotators** (equatorial b
