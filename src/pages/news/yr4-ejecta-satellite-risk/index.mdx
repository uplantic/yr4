When **asteroid 2024 YR4** rocketed onto NASA’s risk tables last year, headlines focused on its fleeting 3 % chance of striking Earth. Subsequent tracking dismissed that fear—but left a **4 % probability** of a direct _lunar_ hit on **22 December 2032**. A new, peer-reviewed preprint from University of Western Ontario astronomer **Paul Wiegert** and co-authors asks an overlooked question: _what happens to Earth-orbiting satellites if the Moon gets whacked by a 60-metre rock?_ The answer, according to their models, is unsettling: the ejecta plume could **shower low-Earth orbit (LEO) with decades’ worth of micrometeoroid impacts in a matter of days**.

In this article we unpack the 30-page study, walk through the physics of high-velocity lunar ejecta, and explore how the Space Age’s densest orbital shell could endure a meteor storm unlike any in recorded history.

#### Study Overview

| Attribute | Details |
|--||
| **Paper** | _The Potential Danger to Satellites due to Ejecta from a 2032 Lunar Impact by Asteroid 2024 YR4_ |
| **Authors** | Paul Wiegert, Peter Brown, Jack Lopes & Martin Connors |
| **Repository** | arXiv 2506.11217 (June 2025) |
| **Key Finding** | Up to **10⁸ kg** of lunar rock could escape, boosting micrometeoroid flux in near-Earth space by years–to-decades worth of background in mere days. |

The work combines hydrodynamic impact codes, ballistic trajectories, and satellite-flux models (MEM 3) to estimate debris sizes from **0.1 mm to 10 mm**—tiny but deadly at orbital speeds.

#### Impact Energy & Crater Size

A 60 m stony body striking the lunar surface at ~11 km/s releases **6.5 megatons of TNT** (≈ 270 Petajoules). That’s enough to blast a **~1 km-wide crater**. Comparable terrestrial energy releases include:

- **Chelyabinsk (2013):** 400–500 kt
- **Castle Bravo (1954 H-bomb):** 15 Mt
- **Tunguska (1908):** 3–15 Mt

On the airless Moon, ejecta aren’t slowed by atmosphere. Anything accelerated above **2.4 km/s**—the Moon’s escape velocity—can sail into cislunar space.

#### How Much Rock Escapes?

Wiegert’s team ran SOVA hydrocode simulations:

- **Total ejecta ≥ escape speed:** **10⁸ kg** (roughly 10 Great Pyramids of Giza)
- **Particle size distribution:** Dominated by sand-grain–sized fragments (0.1–1 mm) but includes centimeter-scale "clinkers."

Trajectories depend on impact latitude and Earth–Moon geometry. If the strike occurs on the near-side hemisphere, up to **10 %** of fast ejecta may intersect Earth's Hill sphere within **72 hours**.

#### Satellite Exposure: A Numbers Game

"The lunar ejecta could deliver **ten years'** worth of normal micrometeoroid hits to every LEO satellite—compressed into a single week." — Wiegert _et al._ (2025)

##### Flux Multipliers

Using NASA's MEM 3 environment model, the authors compare background and post-impact flux at 500 km altitude:

| Particle Radius | Nominal Annual Flux (m⁻² yr⁻¹) | Post-Impact Peak (m⁻²) | Effective "Years of Flux" |
|--||||
| 0.1 mm | ~5×10⁻⁴ | **>2×10⁻²** | 40 |
| 1 mm | ~2×10⁻⁶ | **>1×10⁻³** | 500 |
| 5 mm | ~1×10⁻⁹ | **~4×10⁻⁶** | 4000 |

Most spacecraft can shrug off sub-millimetre hits, but cumulative effects include solar-panel pitting, radiative-cooler erosion, and degraded star-tracker optics. For 5 mm fragments, single collisions can be mission-ending.

##### Vulnerable Constellations

Mega-constellations (Starlink, OneWeb) occupy 300–600 km shells—prime target zones. Mission planners may need to:

1. **Harden surfaces** or add Whipple shields.
2. **Raise or lower** orbital altitudes temporarily.
3. **Schedule attitude modes** that minimise panel cross-section during the high-flux window.

#### A Meteor Storm on Earth

While satellites dodge hyper-velocity sandblasting, Earth's upper atmosphere would ignite a spectacular **meteor outburst**. Debris arriving at ~11 km/s produces bright, long-lasting trails. Model estimates:

- **Peak Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR):** 300–1000 meteors/hr
- **Duration:** 36–48 hours
- **Radiant:** Near the lunar anti-solar point, drifting nightly

Skywatchers could witness the most intense storm since the Leonids of 1966.

#### Uncertainties & Next Steps

| Variable | Current Estimate | 2028 Refinement |
|-||--|
| **Impact probability (Moon)** | 4.3 % | ±0.5 % |
| **Diameter (m)** | 53–67 | ±5 |
| **Spin state** | 20-min single axis | Confirm NPA tumbling? |
| **Shape** | Flat disk | Radar shape model |

The next close approach in **2028** will brighten YR4 to magnitude 21, enabling radar at Goldstone and bistatic echoes via Green Bank. Those data will lock in the 2032 flyby geometry.

#### Policy Implications

1. **"Cislunar Defence"**  
   Planetary-defence frameworks largely focus on direct Earth impacts. This paper argues for expanding the mandate to protect **Earth-orbiting infrastructure** from secondary hazards.

2. **Satellite Insurance & Design**  
   Insurers may ask operators to model rare meteor-storm scenarios. Future LEO platforms could include sacrificial bumpers or momentum-wheel parking modes.

3. **International Coordination**  
   Space-weather centers (NOAA SWPC, ESA SSA) might integrate "lunar-ejecta alerts" into their dashboards, much like solar-storm advisories.

#### Communicating Risk Without Hype

Misreading a 4 % lunar chance as "doomsday" is easy. Key messaging points:

- **Earth safe.** No mass-extinction threat.
- **Moon safe (structurally).** Orbit unchanged.
- **Satellites cautious.** Short-term hazard manageable through mitigation.
- **Science bonanza.** Potential to validate crater-scaling laws.

Balanced outreach prevents "cry-wolf fatigue" while sustaining interest in planetary defence.

#### Conclusion

The **2506.11217** study stretches planetary-defence thinking beyond gravitational keyholes and Earth-impact corridors. A **medium-sized rock** hitting an airless world could still rattle the technological cocoon enveloping our planet. Whether asteroid 2024 YR4 ultimately air-kisses the Moon or passes harmlessly by, the modelling exercise itself is invaluable: it forces agencies, operators, and scientists to imagine edge-case scenarios in cislunar space—_before_ reality writes the script.

**Bottom line:** keep an eye on December 2032. If fate rolls the cosmic dice, humanity may watch a new crater bloom on the Moon's farside—followed days later by the brightest meteor display of the century and a rigorous test of satellite resilience in low-Earth orbit.
