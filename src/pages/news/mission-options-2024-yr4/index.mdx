When **asteroid 2024 YR4** flashed onto the world’s radar in late 2024, it briefly carried a few-percent chance of striking Earth in 2032. That scenario has been ruled out; Earth is safe. Yet a **small, persistent possibility of a 2032 lunar impact** remains, making 2024 YR4 a high-value target for planetary-defense planning and rapid-response reconnaissance. A comprehensive new technical analysis led by Brent W. Barbee and a cross-agency team (NASA, JHU/APL, JPL, Sandia, LLNL, LANL, and university partners) lays out practical **space mission options**—from fast flybys and rendezvous to kinetic and nuclear robust disruption—should the Moon-impact risk crystallize.

The study synthesizes what we know so far—**size ~60 ± 7 m, S-type composition, 4-year orbit, lunar-impact probability peaking near ~4% as the 2025 observing arc closed**—and translates that into timelines, trajectories, and hardware implications. It also weighs a subtle secondary risk: if YR4 were to hit the Moon, the resulting **lunar ejecta could transiently spike the micrometeoroid environment in low-Earth orbit by up to ~1000×**, a short but intense hazard window for satellites and astronauts.

Below is our reader-friendly field guide to that playbook: what can fly, when it must launch, and which knobs actually move the risk needle.

#### Snapshot: What YR4 Is—and Isn’t

- **Discovery & risk evolution.** Found **2024-12-27**; Earth-impact odds briefly climbed to ~3% on **2025-02-18**, then dropped to zero by **2025-02-23** as tracking improved. Meanwhile, the **lunar-impact probability** rose, hovering around **~4%** by May 2025 when the object faded from view.- **Physical properties.** **JWST** mid-IR observations (Mar 2025) constrained the **diameter to 60 ± 7 m** and confirmed an **S-type** taxonomy. Density and porosity remain uncertain; the team modeled a statistically consistent ensemble to bound mission designs.- **Why the Moon impact matters.** Modeling suggests a YR4 strike could loft **10⁸ kg-scale** ejecta into cislunar space, briefly **over-loading LEO with dust-to-pebble debris** well above background—an operational challenge, not a civilization threat.
### Two Families of Countermeasures: Deflection vs. Disruption

The paper divides action into **deflection** (a small push that changes arrival time/aim) and **robust disruption** (a big impulse that breaks and disperses the body into harmless fragments). Each has constraints:

#### The fragmentation line in the sand

Deflection must be gentle enough to avoid shattering a small, possibly cohesive object. A working rule: **keep the imparted ΔV ≤ 10% of the asteroid’s escape velocity** (V_escape), otherwise you risk fragment clouds that could wander into cislunar traffic. For YR4’s size/mass range, that threshold is only **millimeters per second**.
By contrast, **robust disruption** intentionally aims for **ΔV ≥ 10× V_escape**, driving fragments below ~10 m and dispersing them well before the Earth–Moon encounter. That demands far more energetic intercepts but may be easier to deliver on the 2030–2032 timeline than a surgically precise deflection.
#### Why Classic Deflection Is Impractical Here

**Kinetic impactors (KIs)** change momentum via a high-speed hit, with “extra” push from ejecta (the **β factor**). To be safe, any single hit must stay under that **10% V_escape** ceiling. For YR4, the **deflection ΔV** required to shift its 2032 aim **skyrockets if you start late**, and the low ceiling makes it **hard to deliver enough ΔV** without risking fragmentation. In simulations, even chaining many small KI hits quickly becomes **operationally impractical**—especially given build schedules and launch windows. **Bottom line: KI deflection is not a viable plan for YR4.**
**Nuclear standoff deflection** (a carefully tuned detonation above the surface) can impart ΔV in either direction along the **B-plane ζ** axis (timing lead/lag), which is powerful. But the **window when a single impulse below the fragmentation limit suffices** lands around **late-2028 to 2029**—**too tight** for developing, qualifying, and flying a rendezvous-class system from scratch, and **not robust** if uncertainties persist into 2028. **Conclusion: nuclear deflection is theoretically possible, but practically out of reach on timeline and mass-delivery grounds.**
### Robust Disruption Emerges as the Practical Option

Given schedule, geometry, and the small ΔV headroom for deflection, the study finds **robust disruption**—either **kinetic** or **nuclear**—to be **operationally achievable** if, and only if, commitments are made on **2030–2032 launch windows** with clear **backup dates**.

#### Kinetic robust disruption

- **Concept.** Hit YR4 with a **purpose-built, high-mass impactor** at very high relative speed to exceed the **10× V_escape** disruption threshold.
- **Feasible windows.** Launch bands exist in **late 2029–mid 2030**, **late 2030**, **mid–late 2031**, and **early–mid 2032**, with nominal disruption **Aug–Sep 2032** (a few months pre-encounter). The **best early trajectory** (launch **2030-04-08**) disrupts on **2032-08-13**; the **best late trajectory** (launch **2032-04-09**) disrupts on **2032-09-02**. These cover even the **99.7% high-mass** realization (D ≈ 75–80 m).- **Mass and speed.** Trade studies show impactor masses of **~4–12 t** at **~16–25 km/s** can robustly disrupt the full plausible size range.- **Sensing & guidance.** Using a **DRACO-class imager**, the team estimates **≥ 12 h terminal detection** margins even for fast approaches—tight but workable.
#### Nuclear robust disruption

- **Concept.** A **standoff detonation** vaporizes a thin surface layer; the blow-off momentum imparts a large ΔV to the target, **fragmenting and dispersing** it.
- **Yields & heights of burst (HOB).** For YR4’s **highest-mass** case, ~**1 Mt** can deliver the required ΔV with **~85 m HOB**, giving **operational margin** over sub-megaton solutions that require **precariously tiny HOB (~12 m)**.- **Radar fuzing constraints.** Sandia modeling shows **reliable fuzing up to ~15 km/s** approach speeds across several geometries (above that, failure rates rise without filter tweaks). That sets a **practical cap** on terminal velocities for an intercept-style detonation.- **Representative windows.** Example intercept trajectories deliver **~3–13 km/s** arrival speeds with **late-2029, 2030, 2031** launches, and **June–September 2032** arrivals—meeting both **fuzing** and **mass-delivery** needs (≥ 3 t).
**Key operational insight:** irrespective of method, **execute disruption ≥ ~3 months** before the 2032 encounter so that fragments **spread out** and the transient debris environment stays **within tolerable limits** for assets in cislunar space and LEO. Earlier is better; **> 1 month** already reduces Earth/Moon-impacting mass by **2–3 orders of magnitude** in past studies.
#### Reconnaissance: What We Need and When We Can Get It

**Reconnaissance is the linchpin**: you want hard numbers on **mass, porosity, spin state, and exact 2032 aim** before you commit to a disruption architecture. The report surveys **retasking existing spacecraft** and **building purpose-built scouts**.

#### Can any flight-proven spacecraft be retasked?

- **Janus (SIMPLEx twins).** If reassembled and relaunched, **June 2028** or **early December 2028** windows exist for 2028–2029 **flybys** (C3 up to ~100 km²/s²). Imaging quality at **~10 km/s** speeds and small target size needs re-evaluation, but geometry fits solar-distance limits.- **OSIRIS-APEX.** Several **diversion options** exist for a **late-2028 flyby** (~8–11 km/s), even with **dual-flyby** possibilities (YR4 + Apophis). Preliminary modeling suggests **PolyCam** could acquire YR4 **> 24 h** pre-encounter at 11.2 km/s. Trade-off: you’d **sacrifice** prime Apophis rendezvous.- **Psyche.** With 21 kW SEP and ample xenon, **post-Mars-assist diversions** could manage a **rendezvous in 2030** (heavy propellant draw) or a **fast flyby in early 2029** (~8.7 km/s). Again, this **cannibalizes** the prime mission.
**Reality check:** all retasks mean **abandoning primary science** and living with non-ideal sensors/GNC for a small, fast target. The study treats them as **possible but risky** stopgaps.
#### Purpose-built reconnaissance craft

- **Flyby scouts (chemical).** Pareto sweeps show the **sweet spot is a late-2028 launch** with **mid-2029 arrival** and **< 4 km/s flyby speed**—good for imagery and lightcurve/thermal constraints. Later launches push you into **≥ 10 km/s** flybys in **2032**, which is **too close** to act on.- **Rendezvous scouts (chemical or SEP).** **Late-2028** also anchors the best rendezvous designs with **2029–2031 arrivals**. Chemical options often demand **high propellant fractions**; **SEP (Psyche-like)** architectures open more mass-efficient pathways but still need **~3–4 years** of development lead.- **Rapid response (counterfactual).** Even if we had a launch-in-months capability in 2025, YR4’s geometry meant **earliest practical launches in late-2025** with **2027 arrivals**—so **rapid response** is not a cure-all for this particular orbit. It **does** argue for scaling launch energy (C3) and survey lead time for future cases.
**Bottom line:** if you want reconnaissance **early enough to influence** a 2030–2032 disruption mission, you need to **start a scout in late-2025** for **late-2028 launch**. That’s tight but plausible for a modest, focused payload.
#### The B-Plane, Keyholes, and “Don’t Make It Worse”

Deflection or disruption planning lives on the **B-plane**—a 2-D target plane used to express timing/aim uncertainties in close encounters. For YR4, the **lunar-impact “risk chord”** spans **~2628 km** in **ζ**; deflection pushes the clone out of that strip. The team cataloged historical **Earth keyholes**—tiny regions that lead to delayed Earth impacts if you thread them. For YR4’s 2032 geometry, those keyholes are **far from the Earth/Moon** encounter locus; they **don’t constrain** mission design unless you perform an **extreme mis-aim** or **wide fragment spread**.
#### Three Realistic Mission Campaigns

The study outlines **three end-to-end options**, assuming a decision point **before we regain ground-based tracking in mid-2028**. Each builds in **backup launch windows** and acknowledges programmatic reality.

1. **Campaign 1: Flyby scout + Kinetic robust disruption**

   - **Build start:** Q4-2025.
   - **Flyby:** launch **Dec 2028**, arrive **Jun 2029** (< 4 km/s).
   - **KI disruptor:** launch **Apr 2030**, disrupt **Aug 2032** (backup **Apr 2032**).
   - **Use case:** balances early characterization with a **non-nuclear** mitigation.
2. **Campaign 2: Flyby + Rendezvous scout + Kinetic robust disruption**

   - **Flyby:** as above.
   - **Rendezvous:** launch **Nov 2029**, arrive **Jun 2032** (on-scene observer for KI).
   - **KI disruptor:** launch **Apr 2030**, disrupt **Aug 2032**.
   - **Use case:** **best situational awareness**, on-scene monitoring of fragment dispersal.
3. **Campaign 3: Rendezvous scout + Nuclear robust disruption**
   - **Rendezvous:** launch **Nov 2029**, arrive **Jun 2032**.
   - **Nuclear disruptor:** launch **Dec 2030** (backup **Oct 2031**), **standoff detonation Sep 2032**.
   - **Use case:** reduces spacecraft count vs. Campaign 2; **higher confidence** in achieving robust disruption late in the timeline; leverages **standoff ΔV flexibility**.
All three emphasize **branching logic** (“off-ramps”) in case **2028 observations drive the lunar probability toward zero**—preserving value by re-tasking the scout as a **rapid-response demonstration** recommended by recent national strategies.
#### What If 2028 Tracking Rules Out a Moon Strike?

The authors argue there’s **still strong value** in flying a YR4 reconnaissance mission: it satisfies **Decadal Survey** and **U.S. national strategy** calls for **rapid-response demos** on **50–100 m NEOs** and builds the **operational muscle** we’ll need when a future object **does** keep its impact odds high. A **late-2029 rendezvous** would still reach YR4 **months before** the lunar flyby, enabling a **textbook rehearsal** in a live environment.
#### Engineering Nuggets & Constraints (for the technically curious)

- **The ΔV math.** Required **deflection ΔV** grows sharply inside **~months** of the 2032 encounter; safe impulses (≤ 0.1 V_escape) are **only small enough** if applied much earlier—**near YR4’s 2028 perihelion**.- **β-factor realism.** Post-DART, **β ~2** is a reasonable planning value for kinetic hits; could be higher at extreme speeds, but **not a design crutch**.- **NED fuzing.** Radar-fuzed standoff can work up to **~15 km/s** approach speeds with the modeled filters. Above that, **P_fail** climbs unless you adjust the Doppler filter at the expense of SNR. **HOB** of **~85 m** (1 Mt) buys timing margin across YR4 mass realizations.- **C3 and lift.** Several reconnaissance and disruption options assume **Falcon Heavy Expendable** or **Vulcan**-class performance to deliver **multi-ton** payloads or **high-C3** departures.
#### Risk Communication: Keeping It Straight

- **Earth is safe** from YR4 in 2032. That’s settled.
- **The Moon is not “in danger,”** but it’s a **non-zero target**; a strike would make a **new crater** and kick up a **short-lived dust storm** in space—**not** move the Moon or influence tides.- **The real operational risk** is the **temporary spike** in micrometeoroids along **Earth-Moon corridors**—manageable with **alerts, attitude modes,** and **shielding**, but better avoided.
#### Conclusion: A Calm, Capable Path Forward

The new analysis on **space mission options for 2024 YR4** lands on a pragmatic sequence:

1. **Prepare a slim, purpose-built reconnaissance mission now** (late-2025 start) for a **late-2028 launch**, so we can **measure what matters** early in 2029.
2. **Keep robust disruption options alive**—**kinetic** with **2030/31/32** launches or **nuclear standoff** with **2029–2031** launches—each with **backup windows** and **on-scene observers** if feasible.
3. Use **2028 ground tracking** (and any interim JWST detections) to **pivot**: **stand down** if odds collapse, or **commit** to mitigation if the **Moon-strike corridor** persists.
This is what mature planetary defense looks like: **no drama, just timing, tonnage, and telemetry**—stacked in our favor well before December 2032.
