#### Understanding the Risks

Assessing the potential danger of an asteroid or near-Earth object (NEO) is more than just calculating how close it gets to our planet. Scientists at the European Space Agency’s **NEO Coordination Centre** in Italy consider a number of factors:

- **Orbital Path**: A detailed analysis of how each object moves around the Sun — especially where it crosses Earth’s orbit.
- **Size & Mass**: Ranging from a few meters to several kilometers. Larger NEOs could cause catastrophic damage, while smaller ones pose far less threat.
- **Composition**: Rocky, metallic, or loosely packed rubble — a NEO’s composition can drastically influence the impact effects if it does collide with Earth.

Very large asteroids (over a kilometer wide) have mostly been found, and none currently threaten our planet. Very small objects (below 10 meters in diameter) fall into Earth’s atmosphere more often, but generally burn up, causing little to no harm.

#### The Main Concern: Middle-Sized Asteroids

A far larger population of asteroids remain **tens to hundreds of meters** across. These mid-sized bodies are big enough to wipe out a city or region if they were to strike Earth. Because so many remain undiscovered, early detection is crucial. If spotted with sufficient lead time, orbit refinements can pinpoint their path with high accuracy. This advanced warning period could allow us to plan and, if necessary, **execute a planetary defense strategy**.

> **Note**: As of June 2024, no known asteroid poses a serious danger. However, surveys continue to find new objects, underscoring the need for constant vigilance.

#### How ESA Tracks Near-Earth Objects

#### Observatories and Global Collaboration

ESA’s NEO Coordination Centre works with observatories worldwide to:

- **Discover** new objects using specialized telescopes.
- **Confirm** sightings by comparing data from different locations.
- **Refine** each object’s orbit over time, reducing uncertainty in predictions.

With resources like the **Flyeye Telescope** (designed to spot fast-moving space rocks) and cooperation with NASA, the Minor Planet Center (MPC), and other agencies, ESA strives for a **comprehensive sky survey** that maximizes detection rates.

#### Advancing Planetary Defense

In partnership with global institutions, ESA also investigates **active defense measures**. For instance:

- **Coordinating Missions**: ESA’s upcoming **Hera** mission, following NASA’s DART test, aims to study asteroid deflection technology in more detail.
- **Public Outreach**: By alerting the public to new discoveries, ESA emphasizes transparency and encourages amateur astronomers to contribute observations.

#### Why We Care

History and science both show us the potential impact of asteroids:

- **Tunguska Event (1908)**: Flattened around 80 million trees over 2,150 square kilometers in Siberia.
- **Chelyabinsk Meteor (2013)**: A smaller, ~20-meter object that shattered windows and injured over 1,000 people.

Asteroid surveys are essential because **asteroid impacts are among the few natural disasters humanity can potentially prevent**—provided we discover them early enough.

#### Key Takeaways

- **Large Asteroids**: Mostly identified; none threatens Earth right now.
- **Small Asteroids**: Frequent but usually harmless.
- **Mid-Sized Objects**: Greatest unknown; require global collaboration and continued sky surveys.
- **Monitoring & Mitigation**: Ongoing research, advanced telescopes, and international missions (like DART and Hera) aim to keep the planet safe.

By maintaining continual observations, refining detection methods, and preparing potential deflection strategies, **ESA** and its international partners are working tirelessly to ensure we remain vigilant against any asteroid that might one day set its sights on Earth.
